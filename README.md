# Psychic-Game

So I cruised through the first half of this asignment pretty quck, I thought I was going to move on to the word guessing game, I was wrong.
What tied me up for days was figuring out how to reset the "guesses so far" and how to make javascript pick a new letter after every guess.
Also lets say I won 5 times, the score would show 5, but then when I lost, the score went from zero to 6 and vice versa, they were adding
from one another, so that took some time to sort out. AND THEN every time i guessed a letter wrong, the lose score would go up, when it should
only go up when you ran out of guesses.  It really does feel rewarding when you get everything to work, even if it is a simple game.
